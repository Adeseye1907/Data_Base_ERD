This repository contains several ERD files designed to model the database structure for various business scenarios. The files include:

Conceptual ERD: High-level overview of entities and relationships.

Logical ERD: Detailed model with attributes, primary/foreign keys, and normalized relationships.

Physical ERD: Database-specific schema (e.g., SQL tables, columns, constraints).

List of ERD:
1. BookStore Relational Model
2. User Relational Model
3. Gym Relational Model
4. Hospital Relational Model
5. Dubbin Academy ERD
6. Class ERD
7. University Relational Model
8. Drink Store Relational Model

<h3>
  Importance of ERD in business
</h3>

<h5>
1. Clarity & Communication
Provides a visual blueprint of data relationships for stakeholders (developers, analysts, managers).

Bridges gaps between technical and non-technical teams.


2.Database Design & Efficiency
Ensures data integrity by defining constraints (e.g., foreign keys).

Optimizes performance through normalization (reducing redundancy).


3. Business Process Alignment
Maps database structure to real-world workflows (e.g., customer orders, inventory tracking).

Identifies inefficiencies or missing data points in operations.


4. Scalability & Maintenance
Simplifies future modifications (adding new entities/attributes).

Serves as documentation for onboarding or audits.
